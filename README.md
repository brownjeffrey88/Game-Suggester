# Game Suggester
 first asp net core mvc page.
 
Objective is to create a page that will take a user's board game geek username and optional fields: player count, play time, and game weight. It will present them a game from their board game geek collection to play. site should remember username for future visits.

Core objectives are to learn asp.net, mvc, razor, cookies, and js/a js framework. website should be scalable and feature modern css/js touches.

further development can include: user profile creation, with the ability to add games to profile, when games are added site will use BGG api to pull game data to populate optional fields mentioned above to use for future suggestions. The idea behind user profiles is to let a person use the site without having a board game geek account or collection.

secondary further development can include a mobile app(s).
